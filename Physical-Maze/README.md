Overview:

This project focuses on programming a robot to excel in a game namely a physical maze.

The goal is to implement algorithms in C++ to navigate and solve challenges in these games.

This README provides essential information to get started with the project.

Features:

Maze-solving algorithms implementation.

Integration with physical robot hardware.

Visualization of the robot's path through the maze.

Game-solving statistics and analysis.

Prerequisites:

C++ compiler installed.

Arduino IDE for C++ configured.

Installation Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Jordana-GC/Battle-Bot.git
