# Project-BattleBot

This is the repository for the Battle Bot project.

A project wherein 3 robots must solve differing mazes using different skills. A line follower, a line maze and a physical maze.

The 3 different robot algorithms can be found in their respective folders and have their own README that can provide further information regarding the specific task and code.

Happy coding!
